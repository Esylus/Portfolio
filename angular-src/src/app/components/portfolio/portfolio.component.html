                        musical technologies. The site was created in Angular 5 with an Express.js / Mongo.db backend in
                        anticipation of future development that will add HTML5/JS browser learning games to reinforce musical
                        lessons. The following project "Noterize" is a prototype of such a musical learning game. </h6>
